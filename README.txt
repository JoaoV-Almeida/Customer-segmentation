# Olist Customer Segmentation
**Introduction**
* This project aims to build a robust customer segmentation by analyzing purchasing behaviors within the public Olist e-commerce dataset, available on Kaggle. The primary goal is to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach and understand the distinct patterns of consumption among different user groups.

* By leveraging unsupervised machine learning, specifically the K-Means clustering algorithm, this analysis identifies and characterizes different customer profiles. The final output is a set of well-defined customer personas that can be used to inform and direct targeted marketing campaigns, ultimately leading to more effective customer engagement and business growth.

**Business Problem**
* In a vast and diverse e-commerce marketplace like Olist, a "one-size-fits-all" strategy for marketing, sales, and customer service is inefficient and costly. Without a deep understanding of the customer base, the company faces significant challenges:

Ineffective Marketing Spend: Generic campaigns often fail to resonate with the specific needs and motivations of different customers, leading to a low return on investment (ROI).

Lost Sales Opportunities: Sales teams cannot tailor their approach to high-value or high-potential customers, missing chances for upselling and cross-selling.

Customer Churn: A lack of personalized experience can lead to low customer loyalty, with users failing to become repeat buyers.

To overcome these obstacles and drive sustainable growth, Olist needs to answer critical strategic questions about its customers. This project directly addresses this need by using data-driven segmentation to answer the following:

Marketing: Which customer groups should we target with specific promotions?

Sales: How can we optimize sales strategies for different customer profiles?

Product: What types of products appeal to which customers?

Customer Service: Which customers require more attention or support?

Profitability: Who are our most profitable customers?
